The purpose of this project is to develop a tracker app that helps users track their incomes and expenses, as well as setting financial goals. This will be achieved by connecting the user to a database where all their incomes, expenses and financial goals are stored and distributed in their respective tables.

The program needs to fulfill the following specific requirements:

The user is able to add, delete or update an income, expense or financial goal entry.
The user is able to view their incomes, expenses and financial goals in an easy-to-read format.
The user is provided with a monthly budget calculated by the app.
The user is able to add or delete categories from the income, expense or financial goal tables.
This was the final project of my coding bootcamp, where I demonstrated all the skills and tools learnt during my journey. As an addition to the given requirements, I added some features like a number of user-friendly graphics to display all the financial information to the user, as well as the projected savings the user needs to save in order to achieve their financial goals.
